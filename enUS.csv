prologue_000,Our people lived in prosperity. There were no difficulties or wars.
prologue_001,"Until one day, or should I say one night, everything changed."
prologue_002,"Our cerulean starry sky began to move rapidly, and then, it seemed, to fall."
prologue_003,"Strange beings, called Firrelins, emerged from those monstrous craters and suddenly began to attack us."
prologue_004,"Soon, the largest, supposedly star, fell and formed the largest crater, and a proportionally gigantic creature emerged from it."
prologue_005,"We nicknamed it Vehord, the Lupine Lord."
prologue_006,That monstrous wolf apparently commanded the smaller creatures. And the whole attack only got worse...
prologue_007,"As our only choice, we hid underground on our planet."
prologue_008,"It soon became clear that the interior of the Earth was magically indestructible to the stellar beings, but still capable of being invaded, however arduously..."
prologue_009,"Over time, exploring that new world, we were shown everything the world hid."
prologue_010,"Magic, sophisticated engineering, other races like us, and even the gods, though most were far from their full potential or dead."
prologue_011,"We joined forces with the other beings, and over time, we established our own societies and kingdoms."
prologue_012,"And now, we have special troops called Moonlight Travelers, who explore the entire underground in search of resources and to improve themselves"
prologue_013,"So that, when they are together, they can cross the barrier that separates the underground from the surface and face Vehord, and any other Cerulean Lords..."
prologue_014,"So that one day, we may return to the vast kingdom that was taken from us."
